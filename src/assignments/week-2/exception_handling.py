# Write a Python program that attempts to divide two numbers a = 10  b = 0
# and handles a ZeroDivisionError if the denominator is zero. Divide a by b and handle the exception and print the error
#
#
# Apply exception handling to below code and handle an exception if the index is out of range.
# my_list = [1, 2, 3]
# print(my_list[5])
#
#
# Correct this below code with appropriate exception handlings. And finally print “Execution completed”
# def safe_divide(a,b):
#       result = a / b
#       print(f"Result: {result}")
#
# safe_divide(1,0)
# safe_divide(1,”a”)
