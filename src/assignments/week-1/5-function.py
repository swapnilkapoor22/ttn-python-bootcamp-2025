# 4. Write a Python function that takes two parameters as lists and to sum all the numbers in a list.
# a = [8, 2, 3, 0, 7], b =  [3, -2, 5, 1] and return a value.
#
# 5. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with distinct and sorted elements from the first list. a = [4,1,2,3,3,1,3,4,5,1,7]
# Output = [1,2,3,4,5,7]
